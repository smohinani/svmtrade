A full-stack application that predicts market pivot points using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Overview

This project is a quantitative trading tool that:

Detects price pivots and wave structures

Engineers technical features from market data

Trains an SVM classifier to predict directional movement

Displays predictions and confidence levels in a web interface

The application consists of:

Backend: Model logic, feature engineering, data processing, and API endpoints

Frontend: React interface for visualization and interaction

Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

Explore machine learning applications in financial markets

Improve pivot detection and trend classification accuracy

Build production-style full-stack infrastructure around a trading model

Tech Stack

Python

FastAPI (or your backend framework)

React
